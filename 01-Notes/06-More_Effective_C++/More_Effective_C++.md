# More Effective C++

## Basics 

Item 1: Distinguish between pointers and references.
Item 2: Prefer C++-style casts.
Item 3: Never treat arrays polymorphically. 
Item 4: Avoid gratuitous default constructors. 

## Operators 

Item 5: Be wary of user-defined conversion functions. 
Item 6: Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and decrement operators. 
Item 7: Never overload &&, ||, or ,. 
Item 8: Understand the different meanings of new and delete. 

## Exceptions 

Item 9: Use destructors to prevent resource leaks. 
Item 10: Prevent resource leaks in constructors. 
Item 11: Prevent exceptions from leaving destructors. 
Item 12: Understand how throwing an exception differs from passing a parameter or calling a virtual function. 
Item 13: Catch exceptions by reference. 
Item 14: Use exception specifications judiciously. 
Item 15: Understand the costs of exception handling. 

## Efficiency 

Item 16: Remember the 80-20 rule.
Item 17: Consider using lazy evaluation.
Item 18: Amortize the cost of expected computations. 
Item 19: Understand the origin of temporary objects. 
Item 20: Facilitate the return value optimization. 
Item 21: Overload to avoid implicit type conversions. 
Item 22: Consider using op= instead of stand-alone op. 
Item 23: Consider alternative libraries. 
Item 24: Understand the costs of virtual functions, multiple inheritance, virtual base classes, and RTTI. 

## Techniques 

Item 25: Virtualizing constructors and non-member functions. 
Item 26: Limiting the number of objects of a class. 
Item 27: Requiring or prohibiting heap-based objects. 
Item 28: Smart pointers. 
Item 29: Reference counting. 
Item 30: Proxy classes. 
Item 31: Making functions virtual with respect to more than one object. 

## Miscellany 

Item 32: Program in the future tense. 
Item 33: Make non-leaf classes abstract. 
Item 34: Understand how to combine C++ and C in the same program. 
Item 35: Familiarize yourself with the language standard.
